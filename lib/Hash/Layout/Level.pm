=head1 NAME

Hash::Layout::Level - Level definition object for Hash::Layout

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used internally by L<Hash::Layout> and is not meant to be called directly. The list of
hashrefs supplied to the L<levels|Hash::Layout#new> param in the C<Hash::Layout> constructor are each
used as the constructor arguments passed to this class which create separate C<Hash::Layout::Level>
objects for each level.

Please refer to the main L<Hash::Layout> documentation for more info.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 index

The index value of the level (first level is at index C<0>). This is automatically supplied
internally by C<Hash::Layout>.

=head2 name

An optional name/string value for this level. This is purely informational and is not currently
being used for anything.

=head2 delimiter

The character (or string) that is used by L<Hash::Layout> when resolving composite key strings
in to fully qualified key paths and identifying which part of the composite key should map to this level.

Defaults to a single forward-slash (C</>).

=head2 registered_keys

An optional list (ArrayRef coerced into HashRef) of keys that are associated specifically with
this level. Like C<delimiter>, this meta-data is used by L<Hash::Layout> purely for mapping the
sub-strings of a composite key to a specific level.

See the implementation of L<filter()|DBIx::Class::Schema::Diff#filter> in 
L<DBIx::Class::Schema::Diff> for the best example of how C<registered_keys> can be used.
